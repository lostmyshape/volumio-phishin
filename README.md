# Phish.in Plugin for Volumio

Plugin to play over 1,500 live Phish audience recordings from [Phish.in](http://phish.in).  Plugin uses the [Phish.in API v1](http://phish.in/api-docs).

Plugin not yet complete.

TODO (in no particular order):
- fix mpd playback:
  * previous
  * random
  * repeat
  * timer when mute
- ~~impliment prevUri like TuneIn Radio~~
- add art (and figure out how to get it to display)
- add links to phish.net
- gracefully fail search (currently when search fails due to no response from Phish.in, no results return from any music service)
